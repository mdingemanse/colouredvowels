# Coloured vowels â€” materials
This repository accompanies the paper "Cross-modal associations and synaesthesia: Categorical perception and structure in vowel-colour mappings in a large online sample" by Cuskley<sup>1</sup>, Dingemanse<sup>1</sup>, Kirby and van Leeuwen.

<sup>1</sup> Joint first authors.

There are two parts to this repository:

## 1. Open data & code
The data underlying the analyses reported in the paper, including CIELuv based consistency scores and CIELab based structure scores for 1130 participants. Also includes the code for the novel Mantel-based measure of structural isomorphism in cross-modal mappings that we introduce in the paper. See [BRM_colouredvowels_opendata.md](/BRM_colouredvowels_opendata.md) for details.

## 2. Web application
A distributable version of SenseTest, the web application we developed and used for this research. This includes an interface for devising simple cross-modal tasks and a colour picker optimised for research into synaesthesia and cross-modal associations. See [SenseTest](/SenseTest/README.md) for more details.
