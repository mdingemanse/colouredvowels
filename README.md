# Contents
There are two parts to this repository:

1. The data underlying the analyses reported in the paper, along with code for novel Mantel-based measure of structural isomorphism we introduce. See [BRM_colouredvowels_opendata.md](/BRM_colouredvowels_opendata.md) for details.

2. A distributable version of SenseTest, the web application we developed and used for this research. This includes an interface for devising simple cross-modal tasks and a colour picker optimised for research into synaesthesia and cross-modal associations. See [SenseTest](/SenseTest) for more details.
